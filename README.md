# sdBGridViever

***

## Overview
The tool to quickly inspect the grid of evolutionary models of sdB stars
calculated for the [ARDASTELLA](https://ardastella.up.krakow.pl/) research
group.

The models were calculated using the set-up described
by [Ostrowski et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.503.4646O/abstract)
, using the computational resources provided
by [Wroc≈Çaw Centre for Networking and Supercomputing](https://www.wcss.pl/en/).
Evolutionary models were calculated using the
[MESA](https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa) code
([Paxton et al. 2011](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract),
[2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJS..208....4P/abstract), 
[2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJS..220...15P/abstract), 
[2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..234...34P/abstract), 
[2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..243...10P/abstract)),
version 11701, and supplemented by adiabatic non-radial pulsational models
calculated using the [GYRE](https://github.com/rhdtownsend/gyre) code
([Townsend & Teitler 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.3406T/abstract),
[Townsend et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.475..879T/abstract),
[Goldstein & Townsend 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899..116G/abstract)),
version 5.2.

## Available plots
There are three predefined plots available: $\log\,g$ vs. $$T_\mathrm{eff)$$
